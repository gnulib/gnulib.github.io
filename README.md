This is the documentation repository for [**developer documentation**](http://docs.integratingfactor.com) of [Integratingfactor.com](https://www.integratingfactor.com) .


## About
[**Integratingfactor.com**](https://www.integratingfactor.com) is a "consumer services platform" (a.k.a. the digital platform for your life).
It serves the following key needs for consumer services:
* **security** -- been designed from ground up with end to end security as the backbone of the system, with consumer being in control of the AAA of how devices/services interact on their behalf
* **identity** -- different services can work together intelligently based on common identity of the consumer without disclosing any privacy of the consumer
* **interoperability** -- open interoperability via platform APIs is the design foundation, hence services can be built using different choices of IoT middleware and still all will interop with each other based on platform APIs
* **context aggregation** -- platform provides context aggregation at the consumer level, accessible to all services as per consumer approval. This means, intelligence is maximized, and consumer has the control on how this intelligence gets used
* **open standards** -- services are developed on top of an open standards based platform, shared by other developers. This secures consumer's investment protection by allowing service support by 3rd party developers, even if the original vendors are not in service
