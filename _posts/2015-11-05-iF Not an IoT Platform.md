title: If is not an IoT platform

Integratingfactor.com is not an IoT Platform
============================================

Coming from the IoT Inc Meetup #14 today, about &#34;__Choosing the right dining partner__&#34;
by Dean @ Gartner, had an interesting learning:

* many people are building what they call a *platform* to enable IoT applications, and this ranges from big players like Microsoft Azure, to 1-2 person startups
* the word *platform* itself has become very overused. As per Dean&#39;s comments, the IoT middleware food-chain itself has many hops, and each of those hops (or a combination of them) is being called *platform*
* eventually, all platforms are being developed to write/create services
* we have very well established *vertical* platforms (for a specific service), however now people are looking for more *horizontal* platforms
* the *horizontality* is about being able to support different verticals at any of those hops (or a combination of hops) in the IoT middleware food chain
* security is the biggest concern in IoT food chain

So where does Integratingfactor fits in all of these?

With all the &#34;IoT platforms&#34; being developed and talked about, we need to clearly present Integratingfactor as the &#34;**consumer services platform**&#34; (a.k.a. the digital platform for your life) and not &#34;IoT platform&#34;. It serves the following key needs for consumer services:

* **security** &#45;&#45; been designed from ground up with end to end security as the backbone of the system, with consumer being in control of the AAA of how devices/services interact on their behalf
* **identity** &#45;&#45; different services can work together intelligently based on common identity of the consumer without disclosing any privacy of the consumer
* **interoperability** &#45;&#45; open interoperability via platform APIs is the design foundation, hence services can be built using different choices of IoT middleware and still all will interop with each other based on platform APIs
* **context aggregation** &#45;&#45; platform provides context aggregation at the consumer level, accessible to all services as per consumer approval. This means, intelligence is maximized, and consumer has the control on how this intelligence gets used
* **open standards** &#45;&#45; services are developed on top of an open standards based platform, shared by other developers. This secures consumer&#39;s investment protection by allowing service support by 3rd party developers, even if the original vendors are not in service
